    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="Tim Biehl.jpg" alt="Tim Biehl Photo" style="width:150px;height:175px;">

    <p>I grew up in Portland, OR and lived there until I was 19. I grew up playing and
        watching sports. I am a fan of the Portland Trail Blazers and Oregon Ducks football
        and basketball. <br>
        <br>
        I moved to Utah in 2013 to be closer to family. I have been married for 11 years.
        I have 2 daughters and a son on the way in April. In my free time I love spending
        time with them. Even though I don't have a lot of time for it, I love hiking and 
        being outdoors. <br>
        <br>
        I am excited to learn coding as a change in careers. It will be very rewarding
        and look forward to the journey.
